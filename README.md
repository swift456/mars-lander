# Mars Lander Simulation Game 



An old but still popular game is "Lunar Lander", in which you try to land a lunar module safely, with very limited fuel and simple steering controls. By burning fuel at the right moments and swinging the craft about, you can hopefully avoid the craters and land slowly on a nice flat bit of terrain. Or not...
Lunar Lander only models rocket thrust and lunar gravity, and the Moon has no atmosphere to get in the way. Landing on Mars is far more complicated, usually involving an aeroshell, parachutes, then retro-rockets, gas bags or SkyCrane for the final landing. A successful landing depends on an intricate sequence of things happening at just the right moments, and all of this has to happen automatically.
This project is to produce a Mars Lander game that is more physically realistic than Lunar Lander, has more complex decisions to be made, and helps to educate the player about the challenges and solutions involved in landing on a planet like Mars. Ideally the game should be suitable for outreach events, so should have sufficient playability to appeal to interested members of the public.
There are many possibilities for creative game elements: choice of mission scenario, different landing systems available, fuel vs science instruments tradeoffs, graphs, animation and/or telemetry panels during descent, points at which manual action is required, possibility to automate some actions (eg: "jettison heat shield at 14,000 m"), and so on. A design will be negotiated as part of the initial project work.
The game is not expected to be a perfect simulation of the physics of entry, descent and landing systems, but should give a reasonableflavour of the problems involved. Some initial research into existing entry, descent and landing systems (and how they can go wrong) will be necessary to gather information about typical design and parameters of such systems.


## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
