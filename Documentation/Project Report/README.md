# Project Report templates

These document templates are provided as examples that you could use to start your Project Report for the Major/Minor Project (MMP). You are not required to use these templates, but they might be a useful starting point.

You can modify the structure of the document, but it is suggested that unless you have a good reason, the order and titles of the main sections should be kept.

Reasonable effort has been taken to keep the content of the documents synchronised, execpt for minor differences. If in doubt, the LaTeX versions are considered the source version that the other documents are derived from. That is not intended to indicate any preference for LaTeX. You can use any word processor you like in order to produce your report. However, for the purposes of consistency, it is easier to define the LaTeX format as the main source on which the Word and Open Office files are based.

## Word Templates / Open Office Templates

The Word and Open Office Templates are provided as template files. Double click to open in Word / Open Office. This will create a new unnamed document based on this template. There are some example chapters and sections.

Track changes are currently on, showing some points to change on the first few pages.  Please turn them off before printing a final copy - we don't want to see these comments in your submitted report :-)

## LaTeX Template

A style file, `StylesAndReferences/mmp-report.sty` contains the main formatting information. The document `mmp-report.tex` shows an example of how to use the template. The `mmp-report.tex` file defines the main content and includes several files.  You can edit the `FrontMatter/cover.tex` file to modify the  items that appear on the front page.

The example also shows the use of a BibTeX file and how to include it and make references. The example bibliography file is in `StylesAndReferences/references.bib`.
