# About the Project Outline template in LaTeX

Three BibTeX style files are available in this folder.

* authordate2annot.bst - This uses an Author Date style (sometimes referred to as Harvard Style) for citations and references. Citations will appear as the Author name and the date of the reference.
* IEEEannotU.bst - This uses an IEEE style for citations and references. The citations will appear as a number in square brackets, e.g. [1]. This is a modified version of IEEEannot.bst that has removed the sorting so that the items are shown in the order in which they first appear in the document. 
* IEEEannot.bst - This ues an IEEE style for citations and references. It is the one that the IEEEannotU.bst file is based on. The citations will appear as a number in square brackets, e.g. [1]

To change the style file used for the bibliography, change the `bibliographystyle` command in the example tex file. For example, to use IEEEannotU, use the following.

```latex
\bibliographystyle{IEEEannotU}
```

We will talk about references further in the lectures. You can decide to use an Author-Date or IEEE style. For the Project Outline, or main interest is that you are looking at relevant sources of information rather than which style of Citation and Referencing you are using.
